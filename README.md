# TECLA-Photon-Cleaner
TECLA Photon Cleaner is an interactive web-based application that allows users to upload and clean astronomical photon event data stored in FITS files. It automatically identifies and filters out noisy photon bins based on temporal and energy statistics, and provides a side-by-side comparison between the original and cleaned photon counts.
